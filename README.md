# Custom ResNet for Food-101 Classification

**PyTorch | Deep Learning Coursework**

This project implements a deep learning pipeline for image classification on the Food-101 dataset, using a custom-built ResNet architecture. All core layers, including Conv2D, MaxPool2D, Linear, and BatchNorm2D, were implemented from scratch using low-level PyTorch operations (e.g., `unfold`, `matmul`) without relying on high-level modules like `torch.nn.Conv2d`.
